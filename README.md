# Bronchodilator Simulation in Bronchi

## Description
This project simulates the effect of a bronchodilator in one or multiple bronchi using FreeFEM. The simulation is based on the heat equation, with the option to include an advection term, and supports Robin, Neumann, or Dirichlet boundary conditions. The goal is to visualize how the drug diffuses through the bronchial generations.

## Features
- Simulation of bronchodilator diffusion in 1, 2, or 3 bronchial generations
- Option to include or exclude advection effects
- Adjustable simulation parameters (time step, total simulation time)
- Choice of boundary conditions: Robin, Neumann, or Dirichlet

## Prerequisites
- [FreeFEM](https://freefem.org/) installed
- Basic understanding of PDEs and boundary conditions
