# Modeling-the-diffusion-of-a-bronchodilator
This project aims to simulate the effect of a bronchodilator on one or several bronchi. Using FreeFEM, we will produce clear visual results. The model is based on the heat equation with an added advection term, and Robin boundary conditions (a mix of Neumann and Dirichlet) are applied on the bronchi walls.
